# PhD-Prototype-HDSP

##Manuka Honey Hyperledger Fabric 1.4 DLT Solution Prototype (HDSP).
  The HDSP prototype consists of two-part; one is Hyperledger network; second part is a simple UI developed 
  to test the application (in addition to using Postman to test Restful APIs). The code base for both these parts is 
  available in their respective folders in this repository. The README.md files in each of these folders provide a detailed explanation to
  set up the environment, technology pre-requisites and the instructions to run the code. It's a highly technical project using a couple
  of modern technologies, so some familiarity with the technology and its working is expected to make the solution work. 
  Please refer to the PhD thesis, Chapter 4, for further details on this prototype.
